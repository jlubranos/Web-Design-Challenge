# Web-Design-Challenge

I approached the design of this website as modular as the HTML would allow me to. The program utilizes the iframe command which
makes it possible to create the visualization htmls to be broadcast into the landing page box.  It gives the index.html a clean look.

The website is initial executed through index.html.

The index.html in the website executes
    navbar.shtml
    iframe command where the following htmls are connected through the name='window'
        Landing.html
        Maxtemp.html
        Cloudiness.html
        Humidity.html
        Windspeed.html

The Post function in the website execute the following files:
    PostMaxtemp.html
    PostCloudiness.html
    PostHumidity.html
    PostWindspeed.html

The Comparison function executes:
    Comparison.html

The Data function executes:
    Data.html which execute cities.html which is the table generated by csv_2_htm.ipynb

As you can see I have 13 html files including the cities.html file which was generated through Jupyter notebook (csv_2_htm.ipynb).
